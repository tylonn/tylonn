<h2>Hey, everyone!</h2>

### 💻 &nbsp;About Me
I'm a brazilian 🇧🇷 Forest Engineer with passionate about programming and technology.  
🌳 I have a master's degree in Forestry with applications in Remote Sensing and Hydrology.  
📚 Currently I'm studying machine learning engineering, Python, and Rust. In the near future I intend to study a little bit of C and SQL.  
🥰 And I really love passionfruit desserts and Game of Thrones/ASOIAF books.  

✍🏽 I enjoy recording my thoughts and studies on my [blog](https://theilonmacedo.netlify.app/) as a way to share my knowledge and experiences.
